## Cross‑Cutting Systems (Weekly)  
1. **Public Dev‑Log**  
   - *Why:* Accountability & reputation  
   - *When:* Monday goals + Friday reflection (2× 30 min)  

2. **Weekly Demo Call**  
   - *Why:* External feedback, avoid yak‑shaving  
   - *When:* Sunday evening with a builder friend (1 h)  

3. **Metrics Dashboard**  
   - *Why:* Track momentum, course‑correct  
   - *When:* Review on Friday (15 min)  

4. **Knowledge Garden**  
   - *Why:* Reinforce retention & connections  
   - *When:* Capture 3 atomic notes/day in Obsidian

## Obstacles → Mitigations  
- **Context‑switch fatigue**  
  - Focus on one module at a time; park side ideas on a “Later” board  

- **AI over‑autocompleting**  
  - “You type first” rule; track authored % with WakaTime  

- **Plateaus / boredom**  
  - Monthly showcase deadlines; alternate “build” & “teach” weeks  

- **Debug rabbit‑holes**  
  - 20‑minute rule → ask Discord/Stack Overflow after 20 min stuck  

---

## How to Document for Retention  
1. **Design Doc before Code**  
   - 5‑sentence problem statement + 5‑sentence solution overview  

2. **README‑Driven Development**  
   - Update README at each milestone  

3. **Weekend Brain Dump**  
   - Free‑write surprises; publish best bits in newsletter/blog  

4. **Atomic Zettels**  
   - One concept per note; interlink heavily; review weekly  

---

## Why This Plan Compounds  
You shared a ladder: **Fundamentals → Build a SaaS → 10× with AI**.  
This roadmap mirrors that progression **in one evolving codebase**, so every new concept lands in a live product—never isolated tutorials.  
Weekly writing & shipping turns your marketing strengths into a flywheel: each article doubles as both proof of skill and inbound for your SaaS.

## Next Steps (Today, ≤ 2 hrs)  
1. Create a private GitHub repo: `voice-first-saas-journey`  
2. Add a `/plans/` folder and save this roadmap as `README.md`  
3. Push your first commit: a design doc for the Month 1 static site  

> Ping me when that’s done and we’ll scope Week 1 deliverables. You’ve got this! 💪
